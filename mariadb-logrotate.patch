Adjust the mysql-log-rotate script in several ways:

* Use the correct log file pathname for Red Hat installations.
* Enable creation of the log file by logrotate (needed since
  /var/log/ isn't writable by mysql user); and set the same 640
  permissions we normally use.
* Comment out the actual rotation commands, so that user must edit
  the file to enable rotation.  This is unfortunate, but the fact
  that the script will probably fail without manual configuration
  (to set a root password) means that we can't really have it turned
  on by default.  Fortunately, in most configurations the log file
  is low-volume and so rotation is not critical functionality.

See discussions at RH bugs 799735, 547007
* Note they are from Fedora 15 / 16

Update 3/2017
* it would be big unexpected change for anyone upgrading, if we start shipping it now.
  Maybe it is good candidate for shipping with MariaDB 10.2 ?
* the 'mysqladmin flush logs' doesnÂ´t guarantee, no entries are lost
  during flushing, the operation is not atomic.
  We should not ship it in that state
